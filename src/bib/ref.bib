  Abstract                 = {Some key physical aspects of the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) are discussed. The minimum scale of ICF microexplosions is determined by the ability to implode spherical shells with high radial convergence ratios C R and high initial aspect ratios A R0 . The attainable values of C R are limited by large-scale drive asymmetries, while the values of A R0 are constrained by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Under the indirect drive approach to ICF, it is easier to achieve the required uniformity of the drive pressure, but the penalty is a factor 4-5 reduction of the target energy gain as compared to the direct drive option. Spark ignition is a crucial issue for indirect drive targets (at least for those to be used in power reactors), while the targets driven directly by heavy ion beams could, in principle, utilize a less demanding volume ignition scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents a mixture of theoretical work and experimental results relating to the generation and transport of relativistic electrons in fast ignition inertial confinement fusion.

First the theoretical work is presented, which focuses on the effect that a fast electron beam has on a background plasma. The fast electron beam drives a resistive return current in the plasma, which causes Ohmic heating, leading to a pressure gradient, and a \$J {$\backslash$}times B\$ force. Both of these would be expected to cause cavitation in the background plasma. In this work an analytic model has been developed which shows that the pressure gradient is the dominant force, and predicts the significance of cavitation over a range of parameters relevant to fast ignition fusion. In addition to this the timescale on which shocks can form is considered. This work was verified by the development of a one dimensional fluid code which included the effects of a resistive return current, and was used to model shock formation when the cavitation in the plasma is strong. Some results from a two dimensional version of the code are also presented.

The experimental work in this thesis focuses on an experiment which looked at the interaction of a high-powered laser with gold cone targets, similar to those that would be used in cone-guided fast ignition schemes. In this experiment, the effect of defocusing the laser upon the production of hot electrons was investigated. A copper wire was attached to the cones to act as a diagnostic for the hot electrons. A ray-tracing code was developed to better understand the change in intensity inside the cone when the laser is defocused. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the energy coupling of the laser into hot electrons is maintained when defocusing, while the spectrum of the hot electrons softens.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the inception of the laser, there has been a constant push toward increasing the laser peak intensity, as this has lead to opening the exploration of new territories, and the production of compact sources of particles and radiation with unprecedented characteristics. However, increasing the peak laser intensity is usually performed by enhancing the produced laser properties, either by lowering its duration or increasing its energy, which involves a great level of complexity for the laser chain, or comes at great cost. Focusing tightly is another possibility to increase the laser intensity, but this comes at the risk of damaging the optics with target debris, as it requires their placement in close proximity to the interaction region. Plasma devices are an attractive, compact alternative to tightly focus extreme light pulses and further increase the final laser intensity.},

Here we present a fully kinetic large-scale two-dimensional simulation studying laser–plasma interaction and hot electron generation in a relatively long and hot coronal plasma. The simulation shows saturation of the reflectivity of an intense spike pulse and absorption taking place close to a quarter critical density in particular, due to cavitation and stimulated Raman scattering. The signatures of steady two-plasmon decay are observed, but the hot electron number produced by this instability is low in comparison with the other two processes. The spectral and angular distribution of the back-scattered light is presented and the energy and angular characteristics of hot electrons due to individual absorption processes are studied.},

Two classes of reactor are considered: first, self-sustaining systems in which the charged reaction products are trapped and, secondly, pulsed systems in which all the reaction products escape so that energy must be supplied continuously during the pulse. It is found that not only must the temperature be sufficiently high, but also the reaction must be sustained long enough for a definite fraction of the fuel to be burnt.},

The ablation pressure is inferred from the volume of the crater in the Cu layer situated behind the plastic foil and by shock breakout chronometry. The population of fast electrons is analyzed by K α emission spectroscopy and imaging. The preplasma is characterized by three-frame interferometry, x-ray spectroscopy and ion diagnostics. The numerical simulations constrained with the measured data gave a maximum pressure in the plastic layer of about 90 Mbar.},

  Abstract                 = {The physics of indirectly driven targets for inertial confinement fusion — so-called hohlraum targets — is investigated. Scaling relations for radiation heat waves in high-Z and low-Z materials are derived from one-dimensional multigroup simulation. A two-temperature model is developed for radiation cavities including fusion capsules. The efficiency of X-ray transfer to the capsule by multiple absorption and re-emission inside the cavity is obtained as a function of cavity areas and materials. Using gold for the cavity wall and carbon for the capsule ablator, transfer efficiencies between 50% and 33% are obtained for area ratios between 5 and 10, respectively. Also the hydrodynamic efficiency of X-ray driven capsule implosion and the dependence of the implosion velocity on the hohlraum temperature are given analytically, derived from the rocket model. With carbon ablators, hydroefficiencies of up to 20% can be achieved. Under optimal conditions, an implosion velocity of 3 × 10 7 cm/s is reached with a temperature of about 210 eV of the capsule ablator and about 250 eV of the cavity wall. Assuming 70–90% conversion efficiency of beam energy into X-rays (not analysed in this paper), overall coupling efficiencies in the range of 5–10% seem to be possible. One-dimensional simulations of full reactor size targets (10 MJ driver pulses) are presented. The model results compare well with the simulations. Limits in scaling down to smaller systems are discussed; the scaling relation for the required enhancement of implosion velocity and hohlraum temperature is derived.},

  Abstract                 = {In spite of the wide use of Hertzian potentials in special problems there appears to be no account of the general theory which is completely satisfactory-especially with regard to (i) the arbitrariness of the potentials and the relation between different equivalent representations of the same electromagnetic field, (ii) the derivation of the Hertzian potentials for such equivalent representations from the physical sources, and (iii) electromagnetic fields not in vacuo. It is the purpose of this paper to fill this gap. It is shown that the Hertzian potentials may be subjected to a new type of gauge transformation which leaves invariant the electromagnetic field they represent. The particular integrals of the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations are generalized, so that they may be subjected to a related gauge transformation which leaves invariant the physical sources of the field; this leads to a treatment of (ii) above, which appears to be new. Examples, including the Whittaker and Debye-Bromwich two-scalar representations, are given. Finally, the theorem is established that, for any electromagnetic field in any stationary material medium, the particular integral of Maxwell equations may be so chosen that in general the complementary function can be expressed in terms of only two scalar functions (components of Hertzian potentials), previously only known to hold for source-free regions in vacuo.},

This approach allows one to determine the paraxial limit for beams with nondefined spot size and for beams described by more parameters in addition to typical longitudinal wavelength and transverse waist. As examples, the paraxiality of higher-order Hermite, Laguerre, and Bessel-Gaussian beams was completely determined. This method could be extended to nonlinear optics and Bose condensates.},

For plain few-micron-thick foil targets, a linear scaling of the maximum proton energy with laser power is observed and this is attributed to the short acceleration period close to the target rear surface. Although excellent laser pulse contrast was available, slight deformations of the target rear were found to lead to a predictable shift of the direction of the energetic proton emission away from the target normal that could be used for better discrimination of the low-energy part of the spectrum.},
