  Abstract                 = {Some key physical aspects of the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) are discussed. The minimum scale of ICF microexplosions is determined by the ability to implode spherical shells with high radial convergence ratios C R and high initial aspect ratios A R0 . The attainable values of C R are limited by large-scale drive asymmetries, while the values of A R0 are constrained by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Under the indirect drive approach to ICF, it is easier to achieve the required uniformity of the drive pressure, but the penalty is a factor 4-5 reduction of the target energy gain as compared to the direct drive option. Spark ignition is a crucial issue for indirect drive targets (at least for those to be used in power reactors), while the targets driven directly by heavy ion beams could, in principle, utilize a less demanding volume ignition scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents a mixture of theoretical work and experimental results relating to the generation and transport of relativistic electrons in fast ignition inertial confinement fusion.

First the theoretical work is presented, which focuses on the effect that a fast electron beam has on a background plasma. The fast electron beam drives a resistive return current in the plasma, which causes Ohmic heating, leading to a pressure gradient, and a \$J {$\backslash$}times B\$ force. Both of these would be expected to cause cavitation in the background plasma. In this work an analytic model has been developed which shows that the pressure gradient is the dominant force, and predicts the significance of cavitation over a range of parameters relevant to fast ignition fusion. In addition to this the timescale on which shocks can form is considered. This work was verified by the development of a one dimensional fluid code which included the effects of a resistive return current, and was used to model shock formation when the cavitation in the plasma is strong. Some results from a two dimensional version of the code are also presented.

The experimental work in this thesis focuses on an experiment which looked at the interaction of a high-powered laser with gold cone targets, similar to those that would be used in cone-guided fast ignition schemes. In this experiment, the effect of defocusing the laser upon the production of hot electrons was investigated. A copper wire was attached to the cones to act as a diagnostic for the hot electrons. A ray-tracing code was developed to better understand the change in intensity inside the cone when the laser is defocused. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the energy coupling of the laser into hot electrons is maintained when defocusing, while the spectrum of the hot electrons softens.},

Here we present a fully kinetic large-scale two-dimensional simulation studying laser–plasma interaction and hot electron generation in a relatively long and hot coronal plasma. The simulation shows saturation of the reflectivity of an intense spike pulse and absorption taking place close to a quarter critical density in particular, due to cavitation and stimulated Raman scattering. The signatures of steady two-plasmon decay are observed, but the hot electron number produced by this instability is low in comparison with the other two processes. The spectral and angular distribution of the back-scattered light is presented and the energy and angular characteristics of hot electrons due to individual absorption processes are studied.},

Two classes of reactor are considered: first, self-sustaining systems in which the charged reaction products are trapped and, secondly, pulsed systems in which all the reaction products escape so that energy must be supplied continuously during the pulse. It is found that not only must the temperature be sufficiently high, but also the reaction must be sustained long enough for a definite fraction of the fuel to be burnt.},

Two laser beams have been used: the auxiliary beam, for preplasma creation on the surface of a plastic foil, and the main beam to launch a strong shock. The ablation pressure is inferred from the volume of the crater in the Cu layer situated behind the plastic foil and by shock breakout chronometry. The population of fast electrons is analyzed by K α emission spectroscopy and imaging. The preplasma is characterized by three-frame interferometry, x-ray spectroscopy and ion diagnostics. The numerical simulations constrained with the measured data gave a maximum pressure in the plastic layer of about 90 Mbar.},

  Abstract                 = {The physics of indirectly driven targets for inertial confinement fusion — so-called hohlraum targets — is investigated. Scaling relations for radiation heat waves in high-Z and low-Z materials are derived from one-dimensional multigroup simulation. A two-temperature model is developed for radiation cavities including fusion capsules. The efficiency of X-ray transfer to the capsule by multiple absorption and re-emission inside the cavity is obtained as a function of cavity areas and materials. Using gold for the cavity wall and carbon for the capsule ablator, transfer efficiencies between 50% and 33% are obtained for area ratios between 5 and 10, respectively. Also the hydrodynamic efficiency of X-ray driven capsule implosion and the dependence of the implosion velocity on the hohlraum temperature are given analytically, derived from the rocket model. With carbon ablators, hydroefficiencies of up to 20% can be achieved. Under optimal conditions, an implosion velocity of 3 × 10 7 cm/s is reached with a temperature of about 210 eV of the capsule ablator and about 250 eV of the cavity wall. Assuming 70–90% conversion efficiency of beam energy into X-rays (not analysed in this paper), overall coupling efficiencies in the range of 5–10% seem to be possible. One-dimensional simulations of full reactor size targets (10 MJ driver pulses) are presented. The model results compare well with the simulations. Limits in scaling down to smaller systems are discussed; the scaling relation for the required enhancement of implosion velocity and hohlraum temperature is derived.},
