In this section, several possible approaches how to focus a laser beam in experiments are discussed. Before providing a brief overview of currently used methods, it is necessary to introduce a few most fundamental parameters that describe any optical system.

First, one defines a numerical aperture of an optical system $ N\!A $, which is a dimensionless number characterizing the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. Second characteristic of any optical system is a focal length $ f $ describing a distance between the center of the aperture and the point in space over which collimated light rays are brought to a focus. Finally, one defines a f-number $ f/\# $ as a ratio of the focal length $ f $ to the size of the aperture $ D $. The f-number is thus dimensionless and stands for a quantitative measure of a speed of the optical system.

In experiments, focusing of laser beams is usually achieved by means of an optical system, such as a lens or a curved mirror. However, when dealing with a short pulses, lenses are not preferred because they may affect the beam and consequently the quality of the focal spot (Strehl ratio, encircled energy) by frequency-dependent effects, such as chromatic aberration and other nonlinear optical distortions. On the other hand, reflective optics are generally able to produce a diffraction limited image without chromatic effects.
