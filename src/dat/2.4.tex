Absorption of laser energy in laser-plasma interactions is an important issue, which has been closely related to the applications including the inertial fusion research ever since the invention of laser. Intense laser pulse can be absorbed in plasma by different non-linear mechanisms. In the following, the three main mechanisms of absorption of laser radiation are briefly described.
