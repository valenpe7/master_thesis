Absorption of laser energy during the laser-plasma interaction is an important issue to be investigated. The energy of laser pulses can be absorbed in plasma by various different non-linear mechanisms depending on the laser intensity. For the laser intensities considered within this work (above $ 10^{16} \ \mathrm{W/cm^2} $), the plasma is predominantly heated by collisionless absorption mechanisms. These mechanisms are generally characterized by the fact that the energy is transfered to a relatively small part of so-called hot electrons. In the following three subsections, the main mechanisms of collisionless plasma heating are briefly described.
