algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate $ \hat{\vec{E}}_{0, \bot}^{ijn} $ via discrete Fourier transforms in time.
	\item Calculate $ \bar{\vec{E}}_{0, \bot}^{ijn} $ via two-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms in transverse space.
	\item Calculate transverse electric field components at the boundary.
	\item Calculate longitudinal electric field components the boundary.
	\item Calculate the magnetic field at the boundary.
	\item Calculate $ \hat{\vec{E}}_{\mathrm{B}}^{ijn} $, $ \hat{\vec{B}}_{\mathrm{B}}^{ijn} $ via two-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier transforms.
	\item Calculate $ \vec{E}_{\mathrm{B}}^{ij}(t) $, $ \vec{B}_{\mathrm{B}}^{ij}(t) $ for any given time $ t \in [t^{1} - \frac{z_{\mathrm{B}} - z_{0}}{c}, t^{N_{t}}  - \frac{z_{\mathrm{B}} - z_{0}}{c}] $.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
implementation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 2D version of algorithm, Ey, Bx, Bz omitted (identically equal to 0) 
	\item Code written in C++, object oriented to be easily extended to 3D, compiled to static library
	\item Linked into EPOCH as a static library (in order not to disturb the code, for this reason also added support for CMake – machine independent)
	\item Parallelized using hybrid techniques (OpenMP + MPI – computation time in most cases negligible in comparison with the main simulation)
	\item Fourier transforms can be computed using Intel MKL library, FFTW library or without any library (compile time option)
	\item Computed fields dumped into shared files using binary coding (speed up output, save disk storage)
	\item Only transverse component of electric field (Ex) passed to the EPOCH at each time step (no significant slowdown or memory overhead), other fields computed by EPOCH
	\item All new parameters needed for tight-focusing (w0, focal length, etc.) may be specified via input file
	\item Implementation works generally regardless the number of lasers in the simulation or boundaries that they are attached to

To demonstrate drawbacks of the paraxial approximation as well as to evaluate the correctness of the algorithm presented in the previous section of this chapter, several test simulations have been performed. In the following text, a two limit cases are presented. The first simulation employs tightly focused Gaussian laser beam, with the size of the focus comparable with the center laser wavelength, whilst the second one shows the case of the Gaussian beam with the size of the focus one order of magnitude larger than the center laser wavelength, where both approaches should return identical results.
