Since the laser beam is nothing but the electromagnetic wave, the opening chapter has to be logically devoted to the fundamental physical aspects of the classical electromagnetic field theory based on the elegant Maxwell's equations. The reader can find a brief description of the microscopic as well as macroscopic variant of the Maxwell's equations and their general solutions exploiting electrodynamic potentials and Hertz vectors. A short part is devoted also to energy and momentum of the electromagnetic waves. In the last part, one finds the simplest mathematical description of the focused laser beam and conditions of its validity.
