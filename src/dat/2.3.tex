In laser-plasma interaction, the knowledge how the laser beam propagates through plasma is essential. Therefore, a general properties of the electromagnetic wave propagation in plasmas are closer described in this section. One can find the characteristics of propagation in both, unmagnetized as well as magnetized plasma. Particularly, in the case of magnetized plasmas, the waves traveling parallel to and perpendicular to a constant magnetic field are discussed in greater detail.
