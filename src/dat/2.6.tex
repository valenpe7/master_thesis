Absorption of the laser energy during the laser-plasma interaction is an important research topic. The energy of laser pulses can be absorbed in plasma by various different mechanisms depending on the laser intensity. For the laser intensities considered within this work (above $ 10^{16} \ \mathrm{W/cm^2} $), the plasma is predominantly heated by collisionless absorption mechanisms. These mechanisms are generally characterized by the fact that the energy is transfered to a relatively small part of so-called hot electrons. In the following three subsections, the main mechanisms of collisionless plasma heating are briefly described.
