In this section, the properties of a Gaussian beam will be presented.
Propagation along the z axis and a stationary
focus at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system will be
assumed.
Since in ... electromagnetic radiation is described by its propagation in the free space.
In this case E and B fields may be expressed by A alone. 
In general, the forms of laser beams can be usefully deduced from a vector potential that
has a single Cartesian coordinate.
Linearly polarized beams result from a vector potential with only Ax or Ay nonzero
Radially polarized beam results from having only Az nonzero
The solution of wave equation for vector potential A
Assume A is polarized in transverse direction 
The geometry of a focused, cylindrical beam is expressed in terms
of the three parameters (beam waist at focus w0, Rayleigh range - depth of focus zr, beam diffraction angle theta)
theory starts with the exact Maxwell equations and expands the electric field vector in powers of w0/l, where w0 and l are the scaling parameters for the beam waist and diffraction length, respectively.

For many purposes the above form is a good enough approximation

Paraxial approximation seems to be sufficient as long as one is interested in the region close to the beam axis and the focusing is not too tight.
