In this chapter, the achieved results of this work are presented and discussed. The code EPOCH, mentioned before, has been used for all simulations within this work. First, the boundary conditions for efficient absorption of hot electrons have been implemented and thoroughly tested in several test simulations. Second, two large-scale 2D simulations of laser-plasma interaction have been performed. The results have been post-processed and analyzed in terms of energy absorption efficiency, scattered radiation and production of hot electrons in the context of contemporary inertial fusion research.
