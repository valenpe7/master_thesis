When a high-power laser pulse is focused onto the surface of a solid target, a high density plasma layer is produced almost immediately due to the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. The dense plasma expanding from the target surface forms a density profile and the laser-plasma interaction takes place in its lower density part. Many different and often non-linear processes are involved in the laser-plasma interaction. A brief introduction to this field of research, which is rich both in physics and in applications, is provided in this chapter.
