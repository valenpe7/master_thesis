When a high-power laser pulse is focused onto the surface of a solid target, a high density plasma layer is produced almost immediately due to the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. The whole plasma region, which expands at sonic velocities, is dominated by laser-plasma interactions. The laser-plasma interactions offer an environment full of non-linear processes that take place during the propagation of the laser light through the plasma. In this chapter, a brief introduction to this field of research, which is rich both in physics and in applications, is provided. 

%In the inertial fusion experiments, it is essential to deliver the laser energy into the capsule of fusion fuel as much as possible. However, the efficient transport of radiation within the target strongly depends on non-linear processes that take place during the propagation of the laser light in the coronal plasma. with many key questions provide a key gateway to the study of.
