Since the laser beam is nothing but the superposition of electromagnetic waves with high spatial and temporal coherence, the opening chapter has to be logically devoted to the fundamental physical aspects of the classical electromagnetic field theory based on the Maxwell's equations. The chapter contains a brief description of the microscopic as well as the macroscopic variant of the Maxwell's equations and their general solutions exploiting electrodynamic potentials and Hertz vectors. A short part is devoted also to energy and momentum of the electromagnetic waves. In the last part, one finds the simplest mathematical description of the focused laser beam and corresponding conditions of its validity.
