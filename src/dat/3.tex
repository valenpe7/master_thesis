This chapter is devoted to numerical simulations, particularly to the particle-in-cell (PIC) method, which represents one of the most popular numerical algorithms in plasma physics. The mathematical background of this method, description of the individual steps of the computational cycle as well as the stability conditions are all discussed. The last section provides a brief overview of the particle-in-cell code EPOCH \cite{bennett}, which has been used for simulations within this work.
