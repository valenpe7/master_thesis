In this chapter, the results of several large-scale simulations are presented. More specifically, 2D3V PIC simulations of tightly focused p-polarized Gaussian laser beams interacting with solid targets at normal incidence have been performed. Note that all the simulations have been computed using the code EPOCH (see chapter 3) which has been instrumented with the library enabling to simulate tightly focused laser beams (see chapter 4). Afterwards, calculated data have been processed and thoroughly analyzed. Emphasis has been placed mainly on identifying the effects of the laser beam focal spot size on the laser-matter interaction results.
