The beginning of this work summarizes the knowledge required for further understanding of the laser-plasma interaction. In the first chapter, the fundamental physical aspects of the classical electromagnetic field theory based on the Maxwell's equations as well as the description of Gaussian laser pulse using the paraxial approximation are provided. The second chapter is focused on basic physical processes which take place during the interaction of intense laser pulse with plasma. The third chapter is devoted to the particle-in-cell method and the code EPOCH, which has been used for simulations within this work.

The main benefit of this work is a successful implementation of laser boundary conditions that allow simulate tightly focused laser beams using the two-dimensional version of the computational code EPOCH. The correctness of the algorithm as well as the proper implementation have been verified by plenty of simulations and numerical tests. The instrumented code has been exploited for several large-scale simulations employing tightly focused laser beams interacting with solid targets. Obtained results have been processed and thoroughly analyzed. Emphasis has been placed mainly on identifying the effects of the laser beam focal spot size on the laser-matter interaction results.
